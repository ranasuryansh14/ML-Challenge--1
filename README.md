# ML-Challenge-1

## Task Overview
You are given a dataset as a **.txt file** named **‚ÄúParkinsons disease raw data.txt‚Äù**. Your objective is to:
- Convert the unstructured data into a structured format using **Python**.
- Perform **data preprocessing** and **analysis**.
- Train multiple **Machine Learning models** to predict Parkinson‚Äôs disease.
- Compare model accuracies and determine the best-performing model.

---

## Dataset Details
- The dataset consists of **195 observations** and **24 features**.
- The **17th feature (index 16 if zero-based)** is the **target column**:
  - `1` ‚Üí **Parkinson‚Äôs Disease**
  - `0` ‚Üí **Healthy**

## Expected Workflow
### **1. Research on Parkinson‚Äôs Disease**
Before starting the analysis, perform basic research on Parkinson‚Äôs disease, including:
- Symptoms
- Causes
- Diagnosis methods
- Role of voice measurements in detecting Parkinson‚Äôs

### **2. Data Preprocessing**

### **3. Data Standardization & Splitting**

### **4. Model Training & Evaluation**
```python
        "Accuracy for Logistic Regression": LogisticRegression(),
        "Accuracy for SVM (Linear Kernel)": SVC(kernel='linear'),
        "Accuracy for K-Nearest Neighbors": KNeighborsClassifier(),
```
